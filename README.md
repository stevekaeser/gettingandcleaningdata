# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project #

----------


## Files Found in the Repository ##

- README.md: This file.
- run_analysis.R: The R script used to process the project data.  This script assumes that the zip file downloaded is extracted into the same directory as the R script.
- CodeBook.md: A file describing the input data, the process followed to clean the data, and the output data.
- tidyData.txt: The final output of Step 5, also uploaded to the Coursera project site.


## Purpose ##

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Data ##

The data used for this project can be found here: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Project ##
The specific tasks for the project are:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
